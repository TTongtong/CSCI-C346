Using some flavor of JUnit (which should be supported by your IDE of choice!), 
generate tests for each of the methods you have implemented. 
Show that the methods work in both the positive and negative cases. 
What are the conditions where some of these methods should fail? Be sure to test that they act appropriately. 
These should be separate test methods. 
Follow the "Unit Test Best Practices" guidelines from the notes.
